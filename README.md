# Grammer-Bot

-- Must get token from Discord developer portal for bot to run

-- Priority #1 : Getting bot hosted so it can always be online.

-- Possible fixes: Making users be able to be moved directly from a voice to another voice instead of needing to be in a "lobby" type text channel. 
   (Discord is strict on this)

-- Fixing how fast Discord bot is able to update cache. Currently after user is moved to a "Breakout Channel" it takes about 5 minutes for cache on bot
   to update. This means the bot will not be able to move the user back to the main voice channel until after 5 minutes.
